## How to Play

Ultimate Battleships-Prela is based on the classic pen-and-paper game Battleship. You can learn more about the original game on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). In this version, players enter their names and two boards are randomly generated. The player can see their own ships (indicated by @) but not the computer's ships. Guesses are marked on the board with X for misses and * for hits. Players and the computer take turns guessing locations, with the goal being to sink all of the opponent's battleships first.

- **Class Instances for Data Management**: The game uses class instances to manage data such as board states and player information.

### Future Features
- **Customizable Board Size and Ship Number**: Allow players to choose board size and number of ships.
- **Manual Ship Placement**: Allow players to position their ships.
- **Larger Ships**: Introduce ships larger than 1x1.

## Data Model

The game uses a `Board` class model. Two instances of the `Board` class are created to hold the player's and the computer's boards. The `Board` class stores board size, number of ships, ship positions, guesses, board type, and player names. Methods include printing the board, adding ships, and processing guesses.

## Technology Used
- **Python**
- **GitHub**
- **Gitpod**
- **Heroku**

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- **PEP8 Compliance**: Code passed through PEP8 linter with no issues.
- **Invalid Inputs**: Tested with strings, out-of-bounds inputs, and repeated guesses.
- **Local and Heroku Testing**: Ensured functionality in both environments.

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Invalid Row and Column Input
- **Test Name**: Test Invalid Row Input
- **Description**: Verify handling of invalid row input.
- **Steps**: Start the game, enter a valid name, and input invalid coordinates.
